# Software Architecture Analysis Using Mathematical Patterns

## System Decomposition (Set Theory)
`System = Component₁ ∪ Component₂ ∪ ... ∪ Componentₙ`

### Reflective Analysis
↹ system•components•interfaces
⊕ decompose => subsystems
⊕ analyze => interactions
⊕ identify => overlaps
Σ modular•design + integration•points

### Application Example
"Breaking down a monolithic application into microservices while identifying shared resources and dependencies."

## Service Transformation (Category Theory)
`Migration: LegacySystem → ModernSystem`

### Reflective Analysis
↹ system•states•transformations
⊕ map => functionality
⊕ preserve => behavior
⊕ validate => equivalence
Σ migration•strategy + verification•plan

### Application Example
"Migrating from a traditional database to a distributed system while maintaining data consistency and relationships."

## System Evolution (Complex Analysis)
`Evolution(System) = ∑(LocalChanges × Impact)`

### Reflective Analysis
↹ current•state•requirements
⊕ identify => change•points
⊕ analyze => ripple•effects
⊕ integrate => modifications
Σ evolution•plan + impact•assessment
