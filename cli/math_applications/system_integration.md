# System Integration Analysis Using Mathematical Patterns

## Interface Compatibility (Set Theory)
`Interface = Required ∩ Provided`

### Reflective Analysis
↹ systems•interfaces•requirements
⊕ analyze => compatibility
⊕ identify => gaps
⊕ design => adapters
Σ integration•strategy + compatibility•matrix

### Application Example
"Integrating legacy and modern systems by identifying interface overlaps and designing appropriate adapters."

## State Synchronization (Group Theory)
`Sync: StateSpace → ConsistentState`

### Reflective Analysis
↹ states•transitions•invariants
⊕ identify => conflicts
⊕ resolve => inconsistencies
⊕ maintain => invariants
Σ synchronization•protocol + consistency•guarantees
