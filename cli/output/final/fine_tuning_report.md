# Stage 4: Classification Results

## Pattern Analysis

Classification result:
Input: Analyze the current market trends and provide strategic recommendations
Label: analytical
Explanation: The classification is analytical because the core of the task is to analyze market trends, which involves data interpretation, critical thinking, and logical reasoning. While there is a creative element in formulating recommendations, the foundational requirement is to conduct a thorough analysis, making "analytical" the most fitting label.

Classification result:
Input: Design a new feature based on user feedback and technical constraints
Label: creative
Explanation: The classification as "creative" is based on the requirement to design a new feature, which inherently involves generating new ideas and solutions. Although the task also requires analytical and systematic thinking, the emphasis on creativity in developing a feature that meets user needs and adheres to technical constraints makes it primarily a creative endeavor.

Classification result:
Input: Investigate the root cause of system performance degradation
Label: systematic
Explanation: The classification as "systematic" is appropriate because the investigation involves a structured methodology to identify and analyze the factors contributing to performance issues. This approach emphasizes organization, thoroughness, and logical reasoning, which are key components of systematic thinking.

## Recommendations
- Use ↹ (Input) symbol to clearly define agent context and constraints
- Apply ⊕ (Process) operators for explicit action steps
- Leverage Σ (Output) format for clear deliverables
- Maintain consistent symbolic notation across all prompts
- Incorporate agency-specific markers in the syntax

## Best Practices
1. Always include context specification
2. Define clear success criteria
3. Specify behavioral expectations
4. Include validation checkpoints
5. Maintain semantic consistency

## Next Steps
1. Regular prompt evaluation
2. Behavioral validation testing
3. Performance metrics tracking
4. Continuous optimization
5. Pattern refinement
