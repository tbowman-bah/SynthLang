# Set Theory Reflective Prompts

## Union and Intersection
`A ∪ B` and `A ∩ B`

### Reflective Pattern
↹ problem•domains•constraints
⊕ identify => common•elements
⊕ analyze => unique•aspects
⊕ synthesize => unified•solution
Σ integrated•approach + shared•insights

### Example Prompt
"Consider two different approaches to solving this problem. How might we combine their strengths (union) while identifying their common successful elements (intersection)?"

## Power Set
`P(A) = {x | x ⊆ A}`

### Reflective Pattern
↹ solution•space•constraints
⊕ enumerate => possibilities
⊕ analyze => subsets
⊕ evaluate => combinations
Σ comprehensive•analysis + feasibility•matrix

### Example Prompt
"What are all possible combinations of approaches we could take? How do these subsets of solutions interact with each other?"

## Complement
`A' = {x ∈ U | x ∉ A}`

### Reflective Pattern
↹ current•approach•limitations
⊕ identify => gaps
⊕ explore => alternatives
⊕ analyze => completeness
Σ holistic•perspective + blind•spots
