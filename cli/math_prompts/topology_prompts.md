# Topology Reflective Prompts

## Continuity
`f: X → Y` is continuous

### Reflective Pattern
↹ transitions•changes•preservation
⊕ identify => connections
⊕ maintain => continuity
⊕ analyze => boundaries
Σ smooth•transition + preserved•properties

### Example Prompt
"How can we ensure our solution remains robust under small perturbations or changes in conditions?"

## Homeomorphism
`f: X → Y` is bijective and bicontinuous

### Reflective Pattern
↹ transformations•equivalences•preservation
⊕ map => structure
⊕ preserve => properties
⊕ verify => reversibility
Σ equivalent•perspective + structural•insight
