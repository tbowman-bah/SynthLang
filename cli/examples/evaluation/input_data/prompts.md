# Evaluation Prompts

## Traditional Prompting
Write a Python function that generates the Fibonacci sequence.

## Reasoning-Based Approach
Let's break down the Fibonacci sequence generation:
1. First, understand what makes a Fibonacci sequence
2. Then, plan the function structure
3. Finally, implement with proper error handling

## Agentic Flow
As an expert Python developer, create a Fibonacci sequence generator:
1. Analyze requirements
2. Consider edge cases
3. Implement optimal solution
4. Add documentation
5. Verify implementation

## SynthLang Optimized
Using mathematical pattern recognition and DSPy:
1. Define sequence pattern
2. Optimize computation approach
3. Implement with performance considerations
4. Validate correctness
5. Document implementation details
