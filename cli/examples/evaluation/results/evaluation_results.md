```python
def matrix_multiply(a, b):
    # Pattern recognition optimization
    if is_sparse_matrix(a) or is_sparse_matrix(b):
        return sparse_matrix_multiply(a, b)
    # Mathematical optimization
    return numpy.matmul(a, b)

@app.route('/api/data', methods=['POST'])
def handle_data():
    data = request.json
    if data:
        return process_data(data)
    return error_response()
```
- Error handling: Basic
- Validation: Manual
- Documentation: Minimal

After (SynthLang):
```python
@app.route('/api/data', methods=['POST'])
@validate_input(schema=DataSchema)
@rate_limit(max_requests=100)
@document_api
def handle_data():
    """
    Process data endpoint with automatic validation.
    
    Args:
        data (dict): Input data matching DataSchema
    Returns:
        JSON response with processed results
    """
    try:
        validated_data = DataSchema().load(request.json)
        result = process_data(validated_data)
        return success_response(result)
    except ValidationError as e:
        return error_response(e.messages, 400)
    except RateLimitExceeded:
        return error_response("Rate limit exceeded", 429)
```
